    <button class="accordion"> Musician</button>
    <div class ="panel">
      <p>The school orchestra was a program which allowed us youngsters to take up a beautiful hobby. It was in the summer of third grade when I first laid my hands on a violin, something that would become one of my biggest compainions. Initially not having much interest in learning the instrument I stuck with it and as I got to seventh grade I found a private tutor who changed my whole perception of music. Thanks to him, I developed a profound interest in the instrument. To this day I enjoy playing and learning new skills, techniques and songs. </p>

    <button class="accordion"> Chess</button>

      <p>
        Chess is something that I picked up when I was just 7 years old. I was always keen to look for new strategies that would make me win. Being the youngest player in my school, I was the best by the age of 9. Playing in a few Junior High National Championships, I placed 8th in one of these national competations and have won over 25 trophies over many regional competations. Till today I continue to play chess and being a member of the Manipal Institute of Technology college team and Manipal University university team and have also helped lay roots to a new chess club in Manipal.

    <div class ="panel">
      <p>I don't have very much expereince with development. Nevertheless I am very interested to create something out of nothing. The very idea of creating something new which can benefit the society is the soul motivation that I require to aspire new heights in this domain. I continue to learn in my free time and I am currently working on a freelance project that will really give me a feel for the real-world requirement of clients.
